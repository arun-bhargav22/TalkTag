# TalkTag - Anonymous Q&A Platform
Hey there! This is TalkTag, my little project to help shy students ask questions anonymously in class.

- **What It Is**: A web-based Q&A tool with a student form and teacher dashboard.
- **How to Run**: Just open `index.html` in any browserâ€”easy peasy!
- **Cool Features**: Anonymous questions, upvoting, and tag sorting (e.g., Doubt ðŸ¤”).
- **Dream Big**: Iâ€™m hoping to add Adobe PDF exports and an Express add-on down the road!

Feel free to play around and let me know what you think!
